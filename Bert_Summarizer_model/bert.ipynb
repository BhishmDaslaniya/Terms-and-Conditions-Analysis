       "'The Most Underrated Tool in Data Science: NumPyThe power of NumPy and how to effectively use itSoner YildirimFollowFeb 20 · 6 min readEverything about data science starts with data and it comes in various formats. However, we almost always deal with very large arrays of numbers in real life datasets. The full function allows to select the value to be filled in the array. We just need to pass in the dimensions:We can also create an array in a specific range with a specific increment using arange function:The first two arguments specify the range and the third argument is the size of increment. Remember that upper limit is not inclusive with arange function. The random function of NumPy creates arrays with random numbers:random.random creates uniformly distributed random values between 0 and 1.The arguments of random.normal are mean, standard deviation and range in order.random.randint creates an array of integers in the specified range with specified dimensions. NumPy also provides mathematical functions to be used as a vectorized operations. You can always check the documentation on the official website of NumPy for more detail. The examples I show here include small arrays. You can always visit the official website for accessing more detailed information.'"

Parsons and Frank L. Stulen. The first commercial, digital and programmable robot was built by George Devol in 1954 and was named the Unimate. It was sold to General Motors in 1961 where it was used to lift pieces of hot metal from die casting machines at the Inland Fisher Guide Plant in the West Trenton section of Ewing Township, New Jersey.[10]\n",

Robots are blamed for rising technological unemployment as they replace workers in increasing numbers of functions.[12] The use of robots in military combat raises ethical concerns.
